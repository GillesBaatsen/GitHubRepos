Hi, here's the assignment:

The App contains 2 screens; list screen and detail screen. &#9989;

The list screen shows (paginated) list of repos with the following data per item:
- Name &#9989;
- Owner’s avatar image &#9989;
- Visibility &#9989;
- And if the repo is private or public &#9989;
  
Once a user clicks on an item on list screen, it opens the detail screen, which shows:
- Name &#9989;
- Full name &#9989;
- Description &#9989;
- Owner’s avatar image &#9989;
- Visibility &#9989;
- If the repo is priv ate or public &#9989;
- And a CTA button which opens the html_url in an external browser &#9989;

Make the app to cache the data in the database to be able to working (partly) offline. The
cached data needs to be updated once the connection is available. &#9989;
